# K888 Windsurfing Van

## Introduction

Converting my Ford Transit Custom into a practical windsurf van was my main project during the summer of 2021.

Early into this project, I decided to do a write up of materials, tools, methods, etc.

The write-up is partly so that I don't forget stuff and also to share links + tips with other people wanting to fit out their own vans.



## Breakdown

The project was broken down into discrete elements and each one will be written up separately.
